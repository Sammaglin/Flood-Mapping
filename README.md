# Flood-Mapping
This project demonstrates how to use Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-1 SAR data to analyze water bodies using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI).   It allows users to interactively select their Area of Interest (AOI), define a date range, and visualize the results directly in Google Colab.
